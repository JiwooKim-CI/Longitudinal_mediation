## Sharing/Access Information
Files: 
- simulation_model1.R
- simulation_model2.R

The simulation_model1.R file contains code under the assumption of no time-varying confounders, while the simulation_model2.R file includes code with time-varying confounders. All datasets used in the analysis are generated through simulations; therefore, there is no external source for the dataset.
