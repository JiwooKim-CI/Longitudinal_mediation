## Content
This repo includes replication files for the simulation on the two-wave longitudinal mediation analysis.


## Sharing/Access Information
Files: 
- simulation_model1.R
- simulation_model2.R
- plot_model1.R
- plot_model2.R

The simulation_model1.R file contains code under the assumption of no time-varying confounders, while the simulation_model2.R file includes code with time-varying confounders. 
The plot_model1.R and plot_model2.R files are for generating plots using dataset from both models.
All datasets used in the analysis are generated through simulations; therefore, there is no external source for the dataset.

## Reproducibility
The analysis was conducted using R version 4.4.1. The full list of package versions can be found in [session_info.txt](session_info.txt).
